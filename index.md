<p> The squad hasn't been decided yet but we will soon see it</p>
<h2>Probabity of Winning</h2>
<h3>80% - KKR
PBKS - 20%</h3>
<p>I personally think that KKR would win because they have a good set of wins a good set of players. While PBKS also have a chance of winning if their bad luck streak gets over. Currently KKR are on 4th at the points table where PBKS are at 6th at the points table. Let's see if today Mayank Agarwal will be able to play after he was not in the squad XI vs MI who dominated PBKS. Run-scorer KL Rahul might be able to retrieve his title after getting 33 runs in this match.

  <h1>Post Match</h1>
  <p>To start off, <em>my predictions were wrong!</em> And the Punjab Kings Dominate The Kolkata Knight Riders and win by 5 wickets! Youngsters like Venkatesh iyer, Arshdeep Singh, Ravi Bishnoi captured the audience. With Venkatesh iyer displaying a fabulous 67 from 49! Arshdeep Singh getting 3/32 and Ravi Bishnoi getting a 2/22. Although these youngsters captured the eyes of the audience, we can't forget the one who helped PBKS win. KL RAHUL! He got a ashtonishing 67 from 55. Now the Punjab Kings are in the 6th place at the points table while the Knight Riders still stay seated at the top 4.
